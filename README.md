# Python_Kafka_Clone
It involves creating a mini-Kafka ecosystem, complete with a mini-Zookeeper, multiple Kafka Brokers, Producers, and Consumers, using socket programming in Python.

##Project Objectives
Gain a deeper understanding of Kafka Architecture.
Learn principles like Fault-Tolerance, Recovery, and Leader Election.
Set up a mini-Kafka on your system with dynamic configurations.
Monitor Kafka Broker health and perform Leader Elections.
Implement Publish-Subscribe architecture.

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Kafka-like system built using socket programming. The project aims to replicate some of the key functionalities of Apache Kafka, such as message publishing, subscribing, topic creation, and more, all using Python's socket library. With this project, you can explore the inner workings of distributed messaging systems and learn how Kafka's core concepts are implemented from scratch. Whether you're a student interested in distributed systems or a developer looking to understand the internals of message brokers, this project can serve as a valuable resource for hands-on learning and experimentation.
